To implement two-factor authentication with a QR code in a NestJS React frontend/backend application, you need to generate a QR code on the backend and then display it on the frontend for the user to scan with their authenticator app. Here are the general steps you can follow:

Implement a library like Speakeasy or OTP to generate a secret key that will be used to generate the time-based one-time password (TOTP).
Use this secret key to generate a QR code using a library like qrcode or node-qrcode. You can choose to use a free QR code generating API like QRCode Monkey instead.
Encode the generated QR code as a base64 string and send it to the frontend as part of the response.
On the frontend, display the QR code using an image tag with the base64 encoded string as the source.
Prompt the user to scan the QR code with their authenticator app to set up 2FA.
When the user logs in, prompt them for the TOTP in addition to their password.
Verify the TOTP on the backend using the secret key generated earlier.
Note that the exact implementation details will depend on your specific application architecture and requirements.
