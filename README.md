# ft_transcendence
Working on ft_transcendence 42 intra Codam

ft_transcendence, or TR, is a project where we learn to work with Typescript, Java, backend and frontend. learning how to use a database and how to protect the database.

The project is simple, make an user acoutn where one can make a name, profile avatar, password, etc, everything one would need.
have a chat system where one can invite others and see others and see if they're online.
invite someone over to make a pong game, or put yourself in a QEUE, and wait for someone else to join you or you to join them.

The problems and responsibilities we will learn here are that we will work on the same database, we will also be working seperate
from each other, which means that we should communicate on what we are working on, what we have done and how we will proceed.

We also communcate how things will look and decide together if this is how it should look like, while at the same time, have the freedom
to code how we will code it, although we are restricted with the REACT framework.
